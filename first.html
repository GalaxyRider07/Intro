    <p> 
        My name is <b>Kapil Sharma</b>, I was born and raised in Bikaner, Rajasthan and I am currently a First year at <b>SMVIT</b>. I am interested in learning more about coding. Initially, thank you for allowing me to introduce myself.
         I took an interest in learning web dev next . In fact, I continuously took classes in this subject area because I wanted to challenge myself and learn more.
